# @collaborate/platform

The collaborate project aims to house a collection of non-governamental
organizations with all their info, and later with everything they are lacking
support, or need help with. Be it, products, people, money.

Its first functionality will be a way to search for NGOs through city, state
and/or category (kids, elderly, animals, etc) in an easy an intuitive way. In
this initial phase I'll not contact the NGOs about becoming partners, as this
information is shared publicly and it'll not do any harm or involve them
whatsover.

As the project evolves, the plan is to transform the database-like app into a
gamified platform where you can earn collaboration points when helping a NGO.
This points can then be used to convert into products, tickets, or any other
recompensation idea that we can gather from future partners.

At this point the project will try to gather two types of partners: 1) NGOs that
want to participate in the platform, which will then provide us with information
about what they need support with; and 2) private/government organizations that
can provide recompensation items to make the gamified platform attractive for
users. These partners will be called `Parceiros Colaborar`.

The project does not aim to monetize or make money in any way. Its main goal is
for learning, to help NGOs get more help and visibility, help private orgs
to stand out for helping othes and users to find collaboration opportunities
way more easily.

The `collaborate` app itself will be a pseudo-NGO inside the platform
and will declare its hosting costs as a collaboration opportunity for users to
help keep the website alive.
